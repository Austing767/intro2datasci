<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Information security</dfn> ( <dfn class="terminology">infosec</dfn>) is largely the practice of preventing <dfn class="terminology">unauthorized access</dfn> to data.  Unauthorized access is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used in an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the <dfn class="terminology">risks</dfn> of others having access to data are incredibly high.  Because of this, information security typically falls under the risk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that information technologyâ€™s (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with a seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most valuable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of information security professionals.</div>
