## Preface

### A Brief History of This Book

The original version of this book was developed for the Certificate of Data Science program at Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies by the original author, Dr. Jeffrey Stanton. The original authors thanked Ashish Verma for help with revisions to the chapter on Twitter (now X). A PDF version of version 3 of this book and code examples used in version 3 of the book were once available at: [http://jsresearch.net/wiki/projects/teachdatascience](http://jsresearch.net/wiki/projects/teachdatascience). These were forked by Dr. Jan Pearce to create a previous version of this book which was used in the summer of 2020 to teach on online Introduction to Data Science course at Berea College. The Runestone version of this book was created in 2025.
