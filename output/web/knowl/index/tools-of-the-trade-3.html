<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">User Awareness</dfn>: A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform other  <dfn class="terminology">social engineering</dfn> tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user awareness is a critical component of any security plan.</div>
