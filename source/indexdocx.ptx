				<p>
					CHAPTER 11<!-- linebreak -->Popularity Contest<!-- linebreak --><image source='media/image57.png'/>In the previous chapter we found that arrival times of tweets on a given topic seem to fit a Poisson distribution, which is a distribution of probabilities that a certain number of unrelated events (like Tweets) occur within a certain period of time when they occur with a known average rate. Armed with that knowledge we can now develop a test to compare two different Twitter topics to see which one is more popular (or at least which one has a higher posting rate). We will use our knowledge of sampling distributions to understand the logic of the test.
				</p>

				<p>
					CHAPTER 12<!-- linebreak -->String Theory<!-- linebreak --><image source='media/image65.png'/><!-- linebreak --><em>Prior chapters focused on statistical analysis of tweet arrival times and built on earlier knowledge of samples and distributions. This chapter switches gears to focus on manipulating so-called "unstructured" data, which in most cases means natural language texts. Tweets are again a useful source of data for this because tweets are mainly a short (280 characters or less) character strings.</em><!-- linebreak --><!-- linebreak -->Yoiks, that last chapter was very challenging! Lots of numbers, lots of statistical concepts, lots of graphs. Let’s take a break from all that (temporarily) and focus on a different kind of data for a while. If you think about the Internet, and specifically about the World Wide Web for a while, you will realize: 1) That there are zillions of web pages; and 2) That most of the information on those web pages is "unstructured," in the sense that it does not consist of nice rows and columns of numeric data with measurements of time or other attributes. Instead, most of the data spread out across the Internet is text, digital photographs, or digital videos. These last two categories are interesting, but we will have to postpone consideration of them while we consider the question of text.
				</p>

				<p>
					CHAPTER 13<!-- linebreak -->Word Perfect<!-- linebreak --><image source='media/image10.png'/><em>In the previous chapter we mastered some of the most basic and important functions for examining and manipulating text. Now we are in a position to analyze the actual words that appear in text documents. Some of the most basic functions of the Internet, such as keyword search, are accomplished by analyzing the "content" i.e., the words in a body of text.</em>

					CHAPTER 17<!-- linebreak -->Hi Ho, Hi Ho<!-- linebreak -->Data Mining We Go<!-- linebreak --><image source='media/image47.png'/><!-- linebreak -->Data Mining is an area of research and practice that is focused on discovering novel patterns in data. As usual, R has lots of possibilities for data mining. In this chapter we will begin experimentation with essential data mining techniques by trying out one of the easiest methods to understand: association rules mining. More beer and diapers please!
				</p>


				<p>
					CHAPTER 18<!-- linebreak -->What’s Your Vector, Victor?<!-- linebreak --><image source='media/image49.png'/>In the previous chapter, we explored an unsupervised learning technique known as association rules mining. In this chapter, we will examine a set of supervised learning approaches known as support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are flexible algorithms that excel at addressing classification problems.
