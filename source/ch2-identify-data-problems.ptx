    <title>Thinking Like a Domain Expert</title>
  <introduction>
				<p>
					<em>Data Science is different from other areas such as mathematics or statistics. Data Science is an applied activity and data scientists serve the needs and solve the problems of data users. Before you can solve a problem, you need to identify it and this process is not always as obvious as it might seem. In this chapter, we discuss the identification of data problems.</em>

  </introduction>



				<p>
					Apple farmers live in constant fear, first for their blossoms and later for their fruit. A late spring frost can kill the blossoms. Hail or extreme wind in the summer can damage the fruit. More generally, farming is an activity that is first and foremost in the physical world, with complex natural processes and forces, like weather, that are beyond the control of humankind.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this highly physical world of unpredictable natural forces, is there any role for data science? On the surface there does not seem to be. But how can we know for sure? Having a nose for identifying data problems requires openness, curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to ask a lot of questions. In fact, if you took away from the first chapter the impression that a data scientist sits in front of a computer all day and works a crazy program like R, that is a mistake. Every data scientist must (eventually) become immersed in the problem domain where she is working. The data scientist may never actually become a farmer, but if you are going to identify a data problem that a farmer has, you have to learn to think like a farmer, to some degree.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get this domain knowledge you can read or watch videos, but the best way is to ask "subject matter experts" (in this case farmers) about what they do. The whole process of asking questions deserves its own treatment, but for now there are three things to think about when asking questions. First, you want the subject matter experts, or SMEs, as they are sometimes called, to tell stories of what they do. Then you want to ask them about anomalies: the unusual things that happen for better or for worse. Finally, you want to ask about risks and uncertainty: what are the situations where it is hard to tell what will happen next and what happens next could have a profound effect on whether the situation ends badly or well. Each of these three areas of questioning reflects an approach to identifying data problems that may turn up something good that could be accomplished with data, information, and the right decision at the right time.
				</p>

<section xml:id="ch2-stories">
    <title>Understanding Through Stories</title>
				<p>
					The purpose of asking about stories is that people mainly think in stories. From farmers to teachers to managers to CEOs, people know and tell stories about success and failure in their particular domain. Stories are powerful ways of communicating wisdom between different members of the same profession and they are ways of collecting a sense of identity that sets one profession apart from another profession. The only problem is that stories can be wrong.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you can get a professional to tell the main stories that guide how she conducts her work, you can then consider how to verify those stories. Without questioning the veracity of the person that tells the story, you can imagine ways of measuring the different aspects of how things happen in the story with an eye towards eventually verifying (or sometimes debunking) the stories that guide professional work.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, the farmer might say that in the deep spring frost that occurred five years ago, the trees in the hollow were spared frost damage while the trees around the ridge of the hill had more damage. For this reason, on a cold night the farmer places most of the smudgepots (containers that hold a fuel that creates a smoky fire) around the ridge. The farmer strongly believes that this strategy works, but does it? It would be possible to collect time-series temperature data from multiple locations within the orchard on cold and warm nights, and on nights with and without smudgepots. The data could be used to create a model of temperature changes in the different areas of the orchard and this model could support, improve, or debunk the story.

  <section xml:id="ch2-anomalies">
    <title>Identifying Anomalies</title>
				<p>
					A second strategy for problem identification is to look for the exception cases, both good and bad. A little later in the book we will learn about how the core of classic methods of statistical inference is to characterize "the center" the most typical cases that occur and then examine the extreme cases that are far from the center for information that could help us understand an intervention or an unusual combination of circumstances. Identifying unusual cases is a powerful way of understanding how things work, but it is necessary first to define the central or most typical occurrences in order to have an accurate idea of what constitutes an unusual case.
				</p>

				<p>
					Coming back to our farmer friend, in advance of a thunderstorm late last summer, a powerful wind came through the orchard, tearing the fruit off the trees. Most of the trees lost a small amount of fruit: the dropped apples could be seen near the base of the tree. One small grouping of trees seemed to lose a much larger amount of fruit, however, and the drops were apparently scattered much further from the trees. Is it possible that some strange wind conditions made the situation worse in this one spot? Or is it just a matter of chance that a few trees in the same area all lost a bit more fruit than would be typical.
				</p>

				<p>
					A systematic count of lost fruit underneath a random sample of trees would help to answer this question. The bulk of the trees would probably have each lost about the same amount, but more importantly, that "typical" group would give us a yardstick against which we could determine what would really count as unusual. When we found an unusual set of cases that was truly beyond the limits of typical, we could rightly focus our attention on these to try to understand the anomaly.
				</p>

  <section xml:id="ch2-risk-uncertainty">
    <title>Addressing Risk and Uncertainty</title>
				<p>
					A third strategy for identifying data problems is to find out about risk and uncertainty. If you read the previous chapter you may remember that a basic function of information is to reduce uncertainty. It is often valuable to reduce uncertainty because of how risk affects the things we all do. At work, at school, at home, life is full of risks: making a decision or failing to do so sets off a chain of events that may lead to something good or something not so good. It is difficult to say, but in general we would like to narrow things down in a way that maximizes the chances of a good outcome and minimizes the chance of a bad one. To do this, we need to make better decisions and to make better decisions we need to reduce uncertainty. By asking questions about risks and uncertainty (and decisions) a data scientist can zero in on the problems that matter. You can even look at the previous two strategies asking about the stories that comprise professional wisdom and asking about anomalies/unusual cases in terms of the potential for reducing uncertainty and risk.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the case of the farmer, much of the risk comes from the weather, and the uncertainty revolves around which countermeasures will be cost effective under prevailing conditions. Consuming lots of expensive oil in smudgepots on a night that turns out to be quite warm is a waste of resources that could make the difference between a profitable or an unprofitable year. So more precise and timely information about local weather conditions might be a key focus area for problem solving with data. What if a live stream of national weather service doppler radar could appear on the farmer’s smartphone? Let’s build an app for that...
