<div class="para" id="cia-2-2-1">This image is a diagram designed to visually represent the CIA triad, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These are foundational principles in information security.</div> <div class="para" id="cia-2-2-2">The diagram uses a symbolic triangle or text labels to connect each of the three components. The surrounding text provides detailed definitions and examples for each principle of the CIA triad.</div>

<div class="para">While the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an acronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.</div>
<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Confidentiality</dfn> refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores credit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept <dfn class="terminology">confidential</dfn>. You would not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken to ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining confidentiality is a principle of security.</div>
<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Integrity</dfn> is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously, data is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you canâ€™t be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to maintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine that e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the system? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they ordered, all because of an integrity violation.</div>
<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Availability</dfn> means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when needed. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and not allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to be accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of implementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In an extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind, hopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="learning-the-lingo.html#cia">in-context</a></span>
