I would like to thank Dr. Rob Beezer for the creation of [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/) which is the authoring platform of this text and for his amazing level of responsiveness in the PreTeXt support channel. Additionally, I am very grateful to Dr. Oscar Levin both for his responsiveness in the Runestone Discord channels and for work in the creation of PreText converter for [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which made adaption much less time consuming.

Dr. Brad Miller deserves a wholehearted thanks for his work in creating [Runestone Academy](https://runestone.academy/) where this book is hosted, and for his collaborative work with the [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/) authoring group.

Finally, I would like to thank my husband, Bob Fairchild, for his patience and for being my best friend.

## Preface

### A Brief History of This Book

The original version of this book was developed for the Certificate of Data Science program at Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies by the original author, Dr. Jeffrey Stanton. The original authors thanked Ashish Verma for help with revisions to the chapter on Twitter (now X). A PDF version of version 3 of this book and code examples used in version 3 of the book were once available at: [http://jsresearch.net/wiki/projects/teachdatascience](http://jsresearch.net/wiki/projects/teachdatascience). These were forked by Dr. Jan Pearce to create a previous version of this book which was used in the summer of 2020 to teach on online Introduction to Data Science course at Berea College. The Runestone version of this book was created in 2025.

The material provided in this book is provided "as is" with no warranty or guarantees with respect to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

### Data Science: Many Skills

Data Science refers to an emerging area of work concerned with the collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, management, and preservation of large collections of information. Although the name Data Science seems to connect most strongly with areas such as databases and computer science, many different kinds of skills including non-mathematical skills are needed.

## Overview

1. Data science includes data analysis as an important component of the skill set required for many jobs in this area, but is not the only necessary skill.

2. A brief case study of a supermarket point of sale system illustrates the many challenges involved in data science work.

3. Data scientists play active roles in the design and implementation work of four related areas: data architecture, data acquisition, data analysis, and data archiving.

4. Key skills highlighted by the brief case study include communication skills, data analysis skills, and ethical reasoning skills.
