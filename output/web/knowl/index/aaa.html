<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.2.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)</figcaption></figure><div class="para"> Another acronym you’re going to encounter in many different contexts is <dfn class="terminology">AAA</dfn>. It stands for <em class="emphasis">Authentication</em>, <em class="emphasis">Authorization</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Accounting</em> and it is used in designing and implementing protocols. These concepts should be remembered when designing security plans.</div>
<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Authentication</dfn> is the process of confirming someone’s identity. This may be done with user names and passwords or more frequently via <dfn class="terminology">multi-factor authentication</dfn> ( <dfn class="terminology">MFA</dfn>) which requires not only something you know, but something you have (fingerprints, key fob, etc.).</div>
<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Authorization</dfn> refers to keeping track of which resources an entity has access to. This can be done via a permission scheme or <dfn class="terminology">access control list</dfn> ( <dfn class="terminology">ACL</dfn>). Occasionally you will encounter something more exotic where authorization limits users to interactions during a particular time of day or from a particular IP address.</div>
<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Accounting</dfn> refers to tracking the usage of resources. This may be as simple as noting in a log file when a user has logged in to keeping track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use them. Accounting is incredibly important because it allows you to not only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred <em class="emphasis">after</em> a problem is encountered. Accounting also allows system administrators to show irrefutably what actions a user has taken. This can be very important evidence in a court of law.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="learning-the-lingo.html#aaa">in-context</a></span>
